#How to set up Swap file for compiling in Raspberry Pi 3

sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile

#Therefore, Uncomment the next line

CONF_SWAPFILE=/where/is/mounted/usb/mySwap.file

#And change the swap size to 2 GB or desired size

CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048

# SD corrupting is very frequently by the use of swap with SD, so is better to mount an external disk
# Be sure to check where our system locates the device

$ df -h
$ tail -f /var/log/messages

#Then, create a directory under /media to be able to mount your drive

$ sudo mkdir /media/external

# Then, mount it

$ sudo mount -t vfat -o rw /dev/sda1 /media/external/

# To unmount, simply:

$ sudo unmount /media/external/

# Then, let's create a swap file

$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/external/mySwap.file bs=1M count=2048

# It's better to set permissions

$ chmod 60 /media/external/mySwap.file

# Then create a swap size memory

$ mkswap /media/external/mySwap.file
$ swapon /media/external/mySwap.file

#Finally, verify the swap size with

$ free -h

# After all, it's better to reboot all services related to swapping

$ sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop
$ sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start
